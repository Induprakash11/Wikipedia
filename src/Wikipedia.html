                            <strong>Angkor Wat</strong>
                            is a Hindu-Buddhist temple complex in Cambodia. Located on a site measuring 162.6 hectares
                            (1,626,000
                            m2; 402 acres) within the ancient Khmer capital city of Angkor, it is considered the largest
                            religious
                            structure in the world by Guinness World Records. Originally constructed in 1150 CE as a
                            Hindu temple
                            dedicated to the deity Vishnu, it was gradually transformed into a Buddhist temple towards
                            the end of the century. <br><br>
                            Angkor Wat was built at the behest of the Khmer king Suryavarman II in the early 12th
                            century in
                            Yaśodharapura (present-day Angkor), the capital of the Khmer Empire, as his state temple and
                            eventual mausoleum. Angkor Wat combines two basic plans of Khmer temple architecture: the
                            temple-mountain and the later galleried temple. It is designed to represent Mount Meru, home
                            of the
                            devas in Hindu mythology and is surrounded by a moat more than 5 km (3.1 mi). Enclosed
                            within an
                            outer wall 3.6 kilometres (2.2 mi) long are three rectangular galleries, each raised above
                            the next.
                            At the centre of the temple stands a quincunx of towers. Unlike most Angkorian temples,
                            Angkor Wat
                            is oriented to the west with scholars divided as to the significance of this.
                            <br><br>The temple complex fell into disuse before being restored in the 20th century with
                            various
                            international
                            agencies involved in the project. The temple is admired for the grandeur and harmony of the
                            architecture, its extensive bas-reliefs and devatas adorning its walls. The Angkor area was
                            designated
                            as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1992. It is regarded as one of the best examples of Khmer
                            architecture and a symbol of Cambodia, depicted as a part of the Cambodian national flag.
                            The Angkor
                            Wat is a major tourist attraction and attracts more than 2.5 million visitors every year.

                    <h1>Etymology</h1>
                    <hr><br>
                    <p>The modern name Angkor Wat, means "Temple City" or "City of Temples" in Khmer language. Angkor
                        meaning
                        "city" or "capital city", is a vernacular form of the word nokor , which comes from the Sanskrit
                        Pali
                        word nagara Wat Parama Viṣṇuloka meaning "the sacred dwelling of Vishnu".The term might also
                        mean "The
                        king who has gone to the supreme world of Vishnu", referring to Suryavarman II posthumously and
                        intended
                        to venerate his glory and memory.</p><br><br>

                            Angkor Wat was commissioned by the Khmer king Suryavarman II (ruled 1113–c. 1150) in the
                            early
                            12th century in Yaśodharapura (present-day Angkor), the capital of the Khmer Empire. The
                            construction of the temple commenced in 1122 CE and was completed in 1150 CE. The temple
                            complex
                            was constructed on the suggestion of Divākarapaṇḍita (1040–c. 1120). The temple was
                            dedicated to
                            Hindu god Vishnu and the original religious motifs were derived from Hinduism. It was
                            built as
                            the king's state temple in the capital city. While there are no foundation stela or any
                            contemporary inscriptions referring to the temple's name that have been found, its
                            original name
                            is unknown and it may have been known as Vrah Viṣṇuloka after the presiding deity. The
                            work on
                            the temple ceased after the king's death, leaving some of the bas-relief decoration
                            unfinished.

                                In 1177, approximately 27 years after the death of Suryavarman II, Angkor was sacked by
                                the
                                Chams, the traditional enemies of the Khmer. Thereafter, the Khmer empire was restored
                                by
                                Jayavarman VII, who established a new capital at Angkor Thom and the Bayon as the state
                                temple,
                                situated to the north. The temple was dedicated to Buddhism as the king's wife Indratevi
                                was a
                                devout Mahayana Buddhist who encouraged him to convert. Angkor Wat was therefore also
                                gradually
                                converted into a Buddhist site with many Hindu sculptures replaced by Buddhist art.
                                <br><br>After the transformation from a Hindu centre of worship to Buddhism towards the
                                end of the 12th century, Angkor Wat continues to be a Buddhist center till the present
                                day. Historical records show that Chinese envoy Zhou Daguan and traveller Zheng He
                                visited the Angkor Wat in the 13-14th centuries. Zheng He studied the temple
                                architecture which was later incorporated in the Dabaoen Temple and Galazed
                                Pagoda.Angkor Wat is unusual among the Angkor temples in that although it was largely
                                neglected after the 16th century, it was never completely abandoned. Fourteen
                                inscriptions dated from the 17th century, discovered in the Angkor area, state that
                                Japanese Buddhist pilgrims had established small settlements alongside Khmer locals. The
                                inscription also tells of Ukondayu Kazufusa, who celebrated the Khmer New Year at Angkor
                                Wat in 1632. <br><br>

                            to
                            describe it with a pen, particularly since it is like no other building in the world. It
                            has
                            towers and decoration and all the refinements which the human genius can conceive of."
                            In 1860,
                            the temple was effectively rediscovered by French naturalist and explorer Henri Mouhot
                            with the
                            help of French missionary Father Charles-Émile Bouillevaux.Mouhot popularised the site
                            in the West through the publication of travel notes, in which he wrote: <br>
                            <br>One of these temples, a rival to that of Solomon, and erected by some
                            ancient Michelangelo, might take an honorable place beside our most beautiful buildings.
                            It is grander than anything left to us by Greece or Rome, and presents a sad contrast to
                            the state of barbarism in which the nation is now plunged.<br>
                            <br>Mouhot's work was published posthumously in 1864 through the Royal Geographical
                            Society with descriptions of Angkor under the title Travels in the Central Parts of
                            Indo-China, Siam, Cambodia and Laos. In 1861, German anthropologist Adolf
                            Bastian undertook a four-year trip to Southeast Asia and his account of this trip
                            titled The People of East Asia, ran to six volumes and was published in 1868. The books
                            detailed the Angkor monuments but lacked drawings of the Angkorian sites. <br>
                            <br>France adopted Cambodia as a protectorate on 11 August 1863 partly due to the
                            artistic legacy of Angkor Wat and other Khmer monuments in the Angkor region and
                            invaded Siam. This quickly led to Cambodia reclaiming lands in the northwestern corner
                            of the country including Siem Reap, Battambang, and Sisophon which were under Siamese
                            rule from 1795 to 1907. Following excavations at the site, there were no ordinary
                            dwellings or houses or other signs of settlement such as cooking utensils, weapons, or
                            items of clothing usually found at ancient sites. <br>

                            In the 20th century, a considerable effort was launched to clear the plant overgrowth
                            and restore the temple complex. Conservation d'Angkor (Angkor Conservancy) was
                            established by the École française d'Extrême-Orient (EFEO) in 1908. The Conservation
                            d'Angkor was responsible for the research, conservation, and restoration activities
                            carried out at Angkor until the early 1970s with major restoration works undertaken in
                            the 1960s. Cambodia gained independence from France on 9 November 1953 and has
                            controlled Angkor Wat since then. <br><br>
                            Restoration work was interrupted by the Cambodian Civil War when the Khmer Rouge took
                            control of the country during the 1970s and 1980s. Work on Angkor was abandoned
                            during the Khmer Rouge era and the Conservation d'Angkor was disbanded in 1975. Camping
                            Khmer Rouge forces used whatever wood remained in the building structures for firewood,
                            and a shoot-out between Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese forces caused a few bullet holes in
                            bas reliefs. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, far more damage was done to the reliefs
                            by art thieves working out of Thailand who lopped off many sculpture and other
                            structures, including earlier reconstructions. As with most other ancient temples in
                            Cambodia, Angkor Wat also faced extensive damage and deterioration by a combination of
                            plant overgrowth, fungi, ground movements, war damage, and theft though the war damage
                            to Angkor Wat's temples was limited compared to the rest of Cambodia's temple ruins.
                            <br><br>
                            Between 1986 and 1992, the Archaeological Survey of India carried out restoration work
                            on the temple as France did not recognise the Cambodian government at the time.
                            Criticisms have been raised about both the early French restoration attempts and the
                            later Indian work, with concerns over the damage done to the stone surface by the use of
                            various chemicals and cement. <br><br>
                            In 1992, the site was declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Simultaneously, Angkor
                            Wat was listed in UNESCO's World Heritage in Danger (later removed in 2004) following an
                            appeal for help by Norodom Sihanouk together with an appeal by UNESCO to the
                            international community to save Angkor. Zoning of the area was designated to protect the
                            Angkor site in 1994, Authority for the Protection and Management of Angkor and the
                            Region of Siem Reap (APSARA) was established in 1995 to protect and manage the area, and
                            a law to protect Cambodian heritage was passed in 1996. <br><br>In the 21st century,
                            teams
                            from several countries including France, India, Japan, and China are involved in Angkor
                            Wat conservation projects. The German Apsara Conservation Project (GACP) was launched to
                            protect the devatas, and other bas-reliefs that decorate the temple from further damage
                            when the organisation's survey found that around 20% of the reliefs were in very poor
                            condition mainly because of natural erosion and deterioration of the stone but in part
                            also due to earlier restoration efforts. Microbial biofilms have been found degrading
                            sandstone at Angkor Wat. Other work involves the repair of collapsed sections of the
                            structure, and prevention of further collapse. For example, the west facade of the upper
                            level has been buttressed by scaffolding since 2002, while a Japanese team completed the
                            restoration of the north library of the outer enclosure in 2005. Replicas have been made
                            to replace some of the lost or damaged sculptures. <br><br>In December 2015, it was
                            announced that a research team from the University of Sydney had found a previously
                            unseen ensemble of buried towers built and demolished during the construction of Angkor
                            Wat, as well as a massive structure of unknown purpose on its south side and wooden
                            fortifications. The findings include evidence of low-density residential occupation in
                            the region, with a road grid, ponds, and mounds. These indicate that the temple
                            precinct, bounded by a moat and wall, may not have been used exclusively by the priestly
                            elite, as was previously thought. <br><br>

                            Angkor Wat is a unique combination of the temple mountain (the standard design for the
                            empire's state temples) and the later plan of concentric galleries, most of which were
                            originally derived from religious beliefs of Hinduism. The construction of Angkor Wat
                            suggests that there was a celestial significance with certain features of the temple. This
                            is observed in the temple's east–west orientation, and lines of sight from terraces within
                            the temple that show specific towers to be at the precise location of the solstice at
                            sunrise. The Angkor Wat temple's main tower aligns with the morning sun of the spring
                            equinox.[47][48] The temple is a representation of Mount Meru, the home of the gods
                            according to Hindu mythology: the central quincunx of towers symbolise the five peaks of the
                            mountain, and the walls and moat symbolise the surrounding mountain ranges and ocean. Access
                            to the upper areas of the temple was progressively more exclusive, with the laity being
                            admitted only to the lowest level.<br><br>
                            Unlike most Khmer temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the west rather than the east. This has
                            led scholars including Maurice Glaize and George Coedès to hypothesize that Suryavarman
                            intended it to serve as his funerary temple. Further evidence for this view is provided by
                            the bas-reliefs, which proceed in a counter-clockwise
                            direction—prasavya in Hindu terminology—as this is the reverse of the normal order. Rituals
                            take place in reverse order during Brahminic funeral services. Archaeologist Charles
                            Higham also describes a container that may have been a funerary jar that was recovered from
                            the central tower. It has been nominated by some as the greatest expenditure of energy on
                            the disposal of a corpse. Freeman and Jacques, however, note that several other temples
                            of Angkor depart from the typical eastern orientation, and suggest that Angkor Wat's
                            alignment was due to its dedication to Vishnu, who was associated with the west.<br><br>
                            Drawing on the temple's alignment and dimensions, and on the content and arrangement of the
                            bas-reliefs, researcher Eleanor Mannikka argues that the structure represents a claimed new
                            era of peace under King Suryavarman II: "as the measurements of solar and lunar time cycles
                            were built into the sacred space of Angkor Wat, this divine mandate to rule was anchored to
                            consecrated chambers and corridors meant to perpetuate the king's power and to honour and
                            placate the deities manifest in the heavens above." Mannikka's suggestions have been
                            received with a mixture of interest and scepticism in academic circles. She distances
                            herself from the speculations of others, such as Graham Hancock, that Angkor Wat is part of
                            a representation of the constellation Draco. The oldest surviving plan of Angkor Wat dates
                            to 1715 and is credited to Fujiwara Tadayoshi. The plan is stored in the Suifu Meitoku-kai
                            Shokokan Museum in Mito, Japan.<br><br>

                            Angkor Wat is the prime example of the classical style of Khmer architecture—the Angkor Wat
                            style—to which it has given its name. Architecturally, the elements characteristic of the
                            style include the ogival, redented towers shaped like lotus buds; half-galleries to broaden
                            passageways; axial galleries connecting enclosures; and the cruciform terraces which appear
                            along the main axis of the temple. Typical decorative elements are devatas (or
                            apsaras), bas-reliefs, pediments, extensive garlands and narrative scenes. The statuary of
                            Angkor Wat is considered conservative, being more static and less graceful than earlier
                            work. Other elements of the design have been destroyed by looting and the passage of time,
                            including gilded stucco on the towers, gilding on some figures on the bas-reliefs, and
                            wooden ceiling panels and doors.<br><br>The temple has drawn praise for the harmony of its
                            design. According to Maurice Glaize, the temple "attains a classic perfection by the
                            restrained monumentality of its finely balanced elements and the precise arrangement of its
                            proportions. It is a work of power, unity, and style." Architect Jacques Dumarçay believes
                            the layout of Angkor Wat borrows Chinese influence in its system of galleries which join at
                            right angles to form courtyards. However, the axial pattern embedded in the plan of Angkor
                            Wat may be derived from Southeast Asian cosmology in combination with
                            the mandala represented by the main temple.<br><br>

                            The temple complex is surrounded by an outer wall, 1,024 m (3,360 ft) by 802 m (2,631 ft)
                            and 4.5 m (15 ft) high. It is encircled by a 30 m (98 ft) apron of open ground and a moat
                            190 m (620 ft) wide and over 5 km (3.1 mi) in perimeter. The moat extends 1.5 km (0.93 mi)
                            from east to west and 1.3 km (0.81 mi) from north to south.[62] Access to the temple is by
                            an earth bank to the east and a sandstone causeway to the west; the latter, the main
                            entrance, is a later addition, possibly replacing a wooden bridge. There are gopuras at each
                            of the cardinal points with the western one being the largest and consisting of three
                            partially ruined towers. Glaize notes that this gopura both hides and echoes the form of the
                            temple proper.<br><br>
                            Under the southern tower is a statue known as Ta Reach, originally an eight-armed statue of
                            Vishnu that may have occupied the temple's central shrine. Galleries run between the towers
                            and two further entrances on either side of the gopura often referred to as "elephant
                            gates", as they are large enough to admit those animals. These galleries have square pillars
                            on the outer (west) side and a closed wall on the inner (east) side. The ceiling between the
                            pillars is decorated with lotus rosettes. The west face of the wall is decorated with
                            dancing figures and the east face of the wall consists of windows with balusters, decorated
                            with dancing figures, animals and devatas.<br><br>
                            The outer wall encloses a space of 203 acres (82 ha), which besides the temple proper was
                            originally occupied by people from the city and the royal palace to the north of the temple.
                            Similar to other secular buildings of Angkor, these were built of perishable materials
                            rather than of stone, so nothing remains of them except the outline of some of the streets
                            with most of the area now covered by vegetation. A 350 m (1,150 ft) causeway connects the
                            western gopura to the temple proper, with naga shaped balustrades and six sets of steps
                            leading down to the outside on either side. Each side also features a library with entrances
                            at each cardinal point, in front of the third set of stairs from the entrance, and a pond
                            between the library and the temple itself. The ponds are later additions to the design, as
                            is the cruciform terrace guarded by lions connecting the causeway to the central structure.

                            By the 12th century, Khmer architects had become skilled and confident in the use
                            of sandstone rather than brick or laterite as the main building material. Most of the
                            visible areas are sandstone blocks, while laterite was used for the outer wall and hidden
                            structural parts. The binding agent used to join the blocks is yet to be identified,
                            although natural resins or slaked lime has been suggested. The monument was made of five to
                            ten million sandstone blocks with a maximum weight of 1.5 tons each. The sandstone was
                            quarried and transported from Mount Kulen, a quarry approximately 40 km (25 mi)
                            northeast.<br><br>
                            The route has been suggested to span 35 km (22 mi) along a canal towards Tonlé Sap lake,
                            another 35 km (22 mi) crossing the lake, and finally 15 km (9 mi) against the current
                            along Siem Reap River, making a total journey of 90 km (55 mi). In 2011, Etsuo Uchida and
                            Ichita Shimoda of Waseda University in Tokyo discovered a shorter 35 km (22 mi) canal
                            connecting Mount Kulen and Angkor Wat using satellite imagery and believe that the Khmer
                            used this route instead.<br><br>
                            Most of the surfaces, columns, lintels and roofs are carved with reliefs illustrating scenes
                            from Indian literature including unicorns, griffins, winged dragons pulling chariots, as
                            well as warriors following an elephant-mounted leader, and celestial dancing girls with
                            elaborate hairstyles. The gallery wall is decorated with almost 1,000 m2 (11,000 sq ft) of
                            bas reliefs. Holes on some of the Angkor walls indicate that they may have been decorated
                            with bronze sheets which were highly prized in ancient times and were prime targets for
                            robbers. Based on experiments, the labour force to quarry, transport, carve and install so
                            much sandstone probably ran into the thousands including many highly skilled artisans. The
                            skills required to carve these sculptures were developed hundreds of years earlier, as
                            demonstrated by some artefacts that have been dated to the seventh century, before the Khmer
                            came to power.<br><br>

                    <p>
                        According to the 13th-century Chinese traveller Zhou Daguan, some believed that the temple was
                        constructed in a single night by a divine architect. In 1622, The Poem of Angkor Wat composed in
                        Khmer
                        language describes the beauty of Angkor Wat and propagates a legend around the construction of
                        the
                        complex, supposedly a divine castle built for legendary Khmer king Preah Ket Mealea by Hindu god
                        Preah
                        Pisnukar (or Braḥ Bisṇukār, Vishvakarman). In the 17th century, the Japanese believed that the
                        temple
                        was the location of the famed Jetavana garden of the Buddha, which was originally located in the
                        kingdom
                        of Magadha, India. According to another myth, the construction of Angkor Wat was ordered by
                        Indra to
                        serve as a palace for his son Precha Ket Mealea.
